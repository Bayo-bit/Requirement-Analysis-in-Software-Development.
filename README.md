üìåRequirement Analysis in Software Development

Introduction:
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase for a Booking Management System project. It serves as a structured reference that demonstrates how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, modeled, and validated within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the strategic process of discovering, documenting, and refining what a software system must accomplish. It transforms stakeholder needs into actionable and understandable requirements for designers and engineers.

This stage promotes a shared vision among the team and serves as the blueprint for meaningful, efficient development.

‚≠ê Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle because:

‚Ä¢ It eliminates ambiguity, giving everyone a clear picture of the system‚Äôs goals
‚Ä¢ It reduces costly mistakes, catching issues early before development begins
‚Ä¢ It ** improves collaboration**, ensuring alignment between users, clients, and developers
‚Ä¢ It boosts product quality, shaping a solution that truly solves user problems

üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities:

‚Ä¢ Requirement Gathering

Collecting information from stakeholders using interviews, questionnaires, research, and observations.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Elicitation

Exploring and uncovering actual needs, expectations, and hidden requirements through active engagement techniques.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Documentation

Organizing requirements into clear, structured artifacts such as SRS documents, user stories, and system diagrams.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Reviewing and refining requirements while visualizing the system using tools like use case diagrams or flowcharts.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Validation

Confirming that requirements are correct, complete, and truly aligned with business goals.

üß© Types of Requirements

Software requirements are categorized into two major types that work together to shape how a system behaves and performs.

‚úÖ Functional Requirements

These describe what the system should do. They define specific features, operations, and behaviors of the software to support user goals.

Examples for the Booking Management System:

‚Ä¢ Users can search for available rooms or services
‚Ä¢ Customers can create a booking and receive confirmation
‚Ä¢ Admin can approve, modify, or cancel bookings
‚Ä¢ System should store and retrieve booking history
‚Ä¢ Payment processing must record successful transactions

‚úÖ Non-Functional Requirements

These define how the system should perform. They focus on quality attributes such as speed, security, and usability.

Examples for the Booking Management System:

‚Ä¢ System should load pages within 3 seconds for optimal user experience
‚Ä¢ Booking data must be securely stored and protected from unauthorized access
‚Ä¢ The interface should be easy to navigate for all customer types
‚Ä¢ System must support high availability during peak booking periods
‚Ä¢ Users should be able to access the system on both mobile and desktop

üé≠ Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually show how actors interact with the system. They help teams understand user goals and clarify system boundaries early in development.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

‚Ä¢ Provide clear communication between stakeholders and developers
‚Ä¢ Reveal required system interactions and missing features
‚Ä¢ Help identify actors, user goals, and dependencies
‚Ä¢ Support better planning and validation of requirements
