üìå Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the Requirement Analysis Documentation for a Booking Management System. This repository demonstrates how software ideas evolve into a well-structured plan before development ever begins. Clear requirements guide successful projects, prevent confusion, and ensure everyone builds the right thing for the right users.

üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the strategic process of discovering, documenting, and refining what a software system must accomplish. It transforms stakeholder needs into actionable and understandable requirements for designers and engineers.

This stage promotes a shared vision among the team and serves as the blueprint for meaningful, efficient development.

‚≠ê Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is crucial in the Software Development Lifecycle because:

‚Ä¢ It eliminates ambiguity, giving everyone a clear picture of the system‚Äôs goals
‚Ä¢ It reduces costly mistakes, catching issues early before development begins
‚Ä¢ It ** improves collaboration**, ensuring alignment between users, clients, and developers
‚Ä¢ It boosts product quality, shaping a solution that truly solves user problems

üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities:

‚Ä¢ Requirement Gathering

Collecting information from stakeholders using interviews, questionnaires, research, and observations.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Elicitation

Exploring and uncovering actual needs, expectations, and hidden requirements through active engagement techniques.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Documentation

Organizing requirements into clear, structured artifacts such as SRS documents, user stories, and system diagrams.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Reviewing and refining requirements while visualizing the system using tools like use case diagrams or flowcharts.

‚Ä¢ Requirement Validation

Confirming that requirements are correct, complete, and truly aligned with business goals.
